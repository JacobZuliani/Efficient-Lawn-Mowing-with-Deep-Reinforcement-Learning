# MTH-440
Repo for the Dassault Systemes time series prediction model:

Suppose a set of data {R1, R2, . . . , Rn} are collected sequentially during an experiment. The values of R1, . . . , Rn depend on the same set or subset of variables {x1, x2, . . . , xm}. Each variable xj is independent of each other and has a
limited (finite) range of values. Moreover, each xj is a random variable subject to some distribution (could be normal/non-normal).

Question:
Is it possible to train a smaller sequential subset of the data, say R1, R2, . . . , Rk, where k < n, and use it to predict the data values Rk+1, . . . , Rn?

You are free to use whatever tools or programming language of your own choice.
